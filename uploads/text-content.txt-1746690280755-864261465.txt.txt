In the heart of the continent of Yareth, surrounded by forests of whispering pines and shimmering lakes, lay the ancient kingdom of Eloria. Though once a vibrant center of trade and magic, Eloria had faded into obscurity—until the arrival of a mysterious girl named Kaelin.

Kaelin, 17, was not born in Eloria. She arrived on the back of a merchant’s wagon, eyes wide with curiosity and heart heavy with questions. With her tangled black hair and a scar under her left eye, she didn’t speak of her past. The only thing she carried was a worn journal filled with sketches of places she’d never visited and names she’d never heard—except one: Thalor.

Thalor was the name of a tower deep in the Veiled Mountains, forbidden and forgotten. But to Kaelin, it held answers.

She found work in the town square of Eloria, helping an old bookseller named Finnor, who once served as a royal librarian. One stormy evening, Kaelin showed him the journal.

Finnor’s hands trembled. "Where did you get this?"

"It was with me when I woke up outside the merchant’s camp," Kaelin said.

"This symbol…" Finnor whispered, pointing to an etched sigil on the last page—a circle with three crescents. "It’s the mark of the Order of Shadows. They disappeared after the Burning of Thalor Tower… seventy years ago."

Together, they uncovered hidden texts and forgotten scrolls. The journal was no ordinary one—it held spells and diagrams written in Runic, a language thought extinct. But Kaelin could read them effortlessly.

Soon, word reached the royal castle of Queen Lyara, who ruled Eloria with wisdom but also suspicion. Her advisors feared the resurgence of ancient magic. She sent her right hand, Sir Calren, a decorated knight known for his unwavering loyalty, to investigate the girl with the forbidden sigil.

Meanwhile, Kaelin began to change. She could feel the winds around her shift with a thought. Water bent in bowls near her. Her dreams were vivid, always showing a man with silver eyes calling her name from the top of Thalor Tower.

Finnor, fearing the Queen’s wrath, urged Kaelin to flee. But Kaelin needed answers.

She set off toward the Veiled Mountains, joined by Lio, a clever thief she’d once caught stealing apples. Lio had secrets of his own—he once lived in the royal orphanage and had seen strange carvings beneath the palace. Together, they braved wolves, snowstorms, and ghost towns.

Sir Calren pursued them tirelessly, yet with each step, he began to question the Queen’s orders. After finding Kaelin healing an injured child in the village of Braldeth, he hesitated. Could someone who saved lives be the threat he was told of?

Eventually, Kaelin, Lio, and the reluctant Calren reached Thalor Tower. It was in ruins, overgrown with vines and heavy with silence. But the scar under Kaelin’s eye began to glow, and the doors opened.

Inside, memories came flooding back—Kaelin was not from this time. She was a descendant of the original Keepers of the Order, preserved through time via a spell gone wrong. Thalor wasn’t just a tower. It was a time capsule.

Within the top chamber, she found a crystal orb pulsating with power. The silver-eyed man from her dreams appeared—not in flesh, but spirit. His name was Eryndor, the last Guardian. He revealed the truth: Queen Lyara’s bloodline was born from betrayal. She feared magic because it would unveil the crimes of her ancestors.

Kaelin could destroy the orb and let magic vanish forever—or reignite it and bring Eloria back to its roots.

She chose the latter.

As light exploded from the tower, magic spread across the land. Trees began to speak, rivers shimmered gold, and Eloria woke from its long sleep.

Back in the castle, Queen Lyara watched from her window, her face pale. She knew the age of secrets had ended—and the age of truth had begun.
